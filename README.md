👋 Hi, I'm ItsPixL27, known as Neer in the real world.
🏫 I'm a high school student in Sydney, Australia.
💻 I'm currently learning JavaScript to follow up with React to add on to my HTML and CSS skills.
🖥️ I want to learn more programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and C.
🌏 I want to get into a software job, currently thinking about something like cybersecurity, but you know what happens with kids and what they want to be.
